# 🧪 Always Push Never Test

> *“If it compiles, ship it. If it breaks, blame the naveed.”*

Welcome to **Always Push Never Test** — a proud collective of chaotic good developers who believe testing is *optional* and that production is the *only* staging environment worth trusting.

## 🔥 Our Philosophy

- ✅ Hotfixes in prod without backups
- ✅ 100% test coverage (if you count TODO comments)
- ✅ Code reviews are a sign of weakness
- ✅ Merge conflicts are puzzles from the coding gods
- ✅ Every commit is a leap of faith
- ✅ Push to `main` at 3AM (optional, but highly respected)

## 🧙 Rules of the Repo

1. Never write tests.
2. ALWAYS trust code that works on the first try.
3. All bugs are features until proven guilty.
4. Blame Naveed™.

## 📜 Inspiring Quotes

> "Sun Tzu said it best: *‘Push first. Apologize later.’*"

> Stay away from **Naveed**. If he says “trust me, it works” — it doesn’t.
